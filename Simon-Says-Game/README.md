# Simon Says Game

🎮 **Simon Says Game** is a classic memory game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
The goal is to repeat the sequence of lights and sounds generated by the game — the sequence gets longer after each successful turn!

This project demonstrates DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic in JavaScript.
